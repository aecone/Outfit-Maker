## General Info
This is my final project for Stanford's Code in Place 2021 course. Since I always struggled with choosing what outfit I want to wear the next day, I decided to code a program that would give me ideas for potential outfits throughout the week and eventually a month. I only focused on warm-weather clothes since that is the season I was in when creating the program and it is less complex to work with. You just need to provide info on the clothing items you want to be used to create a "closet," which would store the data into a json file. Then, if you want to get outfit ideas, that closet file would be used to provide the random clothing combinations. The user has an option of 5 different weeks full of outfits and each have different 7 day looks.
