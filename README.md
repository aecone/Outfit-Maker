# Outfit-Maker
Since I always struggled with choosing what outfit I want to wear the next day, I decided to code a program that would give me ideas for potential outfits throughout the week and eventually a month. You just need to provide info on the clothing items you want to be used and just indicate which week you are in out of a month. Then, 7 combos of a top and bottom would be randomly selected for the user.
